MSSE Journal: Codes and Features to be Published for Readers

Inputs:
The inputs of the proposed framework are the extracted features from the datasets. The features from the three datasets, which are mentioned in the paper, are extracted and given in the FET folder. The structure of the feature file can be found there. 

To Run: 
1) Just run the mainfile.m. 
(It will take all features and apply proposed techniques) 

Outputs: 
The results will be generated (.csv) inside the FET folder.


Thanks.
